# Risk-Revenue

In my role as a Supply Chain Analyst, the company emphasized using Google Sheets as a preferred tool. I built this in Google Apps Script as a stopgap solution to improve consistency of order tracking and reduce duplication of work, as well as to serve as a proof of concept for RDMS-like design. 

The script provided a solution to several requirements:

 - The solution be built within Google Sheets

 - Separate teams providing different information update and edit separate files

 - Unique information need only be entered once

 - New columns to the output table could be dynamically customized
